### Introduction

One of the largest projects I've worked on to date, MaxScore for iPad is a software package developed for realtime distribution of musical scores to musicians for live performance. It was commissioned by Dr.Â Arne Eigenfeldt for use in his research in [music for humans by machines](https://aeigenfeldt.wordpress.com/music-for-humans-by-machine/){:target='_blank'}.

MaxScore for iPad has been used in two performances of Dr. Eigenfelt's *An Unnatural Selection*. The first performance was by Vancouver's Turning Point Ensemble May 2, 2014 at SFU Woodwards in Vancouver, and the second at Sound and Music Computing in Hamburg, August 2016, as part of the S.T.R.E.A.M. Festival at Kampnagel.
