CP0X0E is a free EP released on [ChordPunch](http://chordpunch.com/). It features four tracks that were generated by the AI known as [GESMI](https://aeigenfeldt.wordpress.com/works/music-by-machine-for-dancing/), created by Dr. Arne Eigenfeldt.

As GESMI had yet to learn how to select and control instrument timbres, I assumed the role under the name Awkward Stranger. I was tasked with bringing the composition to life by crafting the sounds for each instrument, as a sort of producer.

Below is one of the tracks from the EP, but you can download the entire thing in high definition over [here](http://chordpunch.com/cp0x0e/).
