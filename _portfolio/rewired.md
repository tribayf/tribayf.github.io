The inaugural performance of SFU's New Media Performance club (NMP), sadly now defunct. We organized an event at W2 with DJ's and projectors galore.<!--more--> The event was in collaboration with SFU's Faculty of Communication, Art and Technology (FCAT), with sponsorship from W2.

NMP performed a piece incorporating contemporary dance, projection mapping, and for my part, live sound synthesis in which the room sound was fed into a chaotic array of feedback delays + granulator. Unfortunately we neglected get somebody to film it, but you can try out my performance [patch](/assets/img/portfolio/rewired/max.zip) if you have Max/MSP installed. Below is a sample of what the patch is capable of.
