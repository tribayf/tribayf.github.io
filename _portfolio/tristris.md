A Tetris clone written in pure JavaScript (ES6).<!--more--> No libraries or frameworks used, only Babel to transpile down to ES5, and Webpack for distribution. Everything else is hand rolled. Visit the [repo](https://github.com/tribayf/tristris) to view the code, controls, and for a link to the game!
