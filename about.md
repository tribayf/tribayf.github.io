Hello, I'm Tristan and I make software. Born and raised in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, I grew up around the likes of teachers, authors, artists, musicians, and people who enjoy working with their hands. All of whom have in some way influenced who I am today.  I enjoy creating, building, problem solving, and sharing the knowledge I gain along the way.

In 2016, I graduated from Computing Science at SFU, where I focused my studies on multimedia computing and electroacoustic music composition.  I worked for several years as a research assistant in the field of [musical metacreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_art), and have contributed to projects including the Metacreation Lab's [Generative Electronica Research Project (GERP)](http://metacreation.net/generative-electronica-research-project), and Musical Metacreation's (MuMe) [Musebots](http://musicalmetacreation.org/musebots/) project. As a research assistant, I developed software tools, conducted music analyses, and shared my knowledge of electronic music production.

More recently, I have become interested in game development and am hoping to break into the field. I've created this site as a platform for showcasing some of the work I have done.
