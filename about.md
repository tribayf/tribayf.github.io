Hello, I'm Tristan! I was born and raised in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia.  I grew up around the likes of teachers, authors, artists, musicians, and people who enjoy working with their hands&#x200b;---&#x200b;all of whom have in some way influenced who I am today.  I enjoy creating, building, problem solving, and sharing the knowledge I gain along the way.

I have many interests, particularly music and computing.  In 2016, I graduated from Computing Science at SFU, where my studies were focused on multimedia computing, completing the Multimedia Specialist designation for my degree, and electroacoustic music composition.  I also worked for several years as a research assistant for SFU's [Metacreation Lab](http://metacreation.net){:target="_blank"}, which is headed by Dr. Arne Eigenfeldt and Dr. Philippe Pasquier.  I have contributed to both the [Generative Electronica Research Project (GERP)](http://metacreation.net/generative-electronica-research-project){:target="_blank"}, and the [Musebots](http://musicalmetacreation.org/) project, where I conducted music analyses, developed software tools, and provided insights into electronic music production.

More recently, I have become interested in game development and am hoping to break into the field. I've created this site as a platform for showcasing myself and some of the work I have done.
